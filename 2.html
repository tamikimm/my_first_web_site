    <p>Be here with me
    I'm tryna stay afloat but I'm in deep (But I'm in deep) Oh, I'm so tired I can't even sleep<br>
    Oh, and I never prioritize my wants and needs So it goes, on and on, just like a melody<br>
    And I keep saying okay (Okay) I never listen to my own heart<br>
    I do whatever they sy (They say) While looking like you're happy as hell<br>
    (Oh, I) I really hope that you feel the same (Oh, I) Tonight<br>
